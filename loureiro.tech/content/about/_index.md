Hello, I'm a Site Reliability Engineer currently living in São Carlos, Brazil, and this is the career path I am passionately pursuing. My journey began in law, providing me with a strong foundation in critical thinking and problem-solving. Currently, I'm broadening my technical acumen as an Information Systems undergraduate at Universidade de São Paulo (USP).

Transitioning from law to the technology sector, I've immersed myself in Software Engineering and DevOps. I'm actively developing my proficiency in Golang, focusing on constructing CLIs and APIs. My goal is to harness the capabilities of Golang's concurrency model and its versatile libraries.

In the sphere of DevOps and SRE, my interest lies in infrastructure as code, scripting for automation, and learning to engineer robust cloud solutions using platforms like AWS and Azure. A crucial part of my education is understanding Observability Engineering principles, underlining my commitment to shipping code swiftly and confidently to maintain production excellence.

With a unique blend of a legal background and an ever-expanding knowledge in technology, I'm prepared to navigate the challenges ahead in my chosen career path as a Site Reliability Engineer. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!
